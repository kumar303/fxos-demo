Firefox OS app demo
===================

This is a simple app that shows tweets in the #mozfest hashtag.

Install the `Firefox OS simulator <http://people.mozilla.com/~myk/r2d2b2g/>`_
to see it in action.
You'll have to deploy it to github pages to install it into the simular.
As an example, just install this URL in the simulator:
kumar303.github.com/firefoxos-demo/manifest.webapp
